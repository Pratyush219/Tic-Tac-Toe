I built a single-player tic-tac-toe game.
###Rules

First, you are required to select the letter with which you want to play - X or O<br/>
You are supposed to enter a number which will be the position where you want to insert the letter (The cells and their corresponding positions are shown above).<br/>
The player who gets 3 consecutive Xs or Os(horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins.<br/>
