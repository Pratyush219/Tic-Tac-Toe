I built a single-player tic-tac-toe game.
Rules :-<br/>
The grid is numbered as follows:<br/>
         |         |<br/>
    1    |    2    |    3     <br/>
_________|_________|_________<br/>
         |         |<br/>
    4    |    5    |    6     <br/>
_________|_________|_________<br/>
         |         |<br/>
    7    |    8    |    9     <br/>
         |         |<br/>

First, you are required to select the letter with which you want to play - X or O<br/>
You are supposed to enter a number which will be the position where you want to insert the letter (The cells and their corresponding positions are shown above).<br/>
The player who gets 3 consecutive Xs or Os(horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins.<br/>
