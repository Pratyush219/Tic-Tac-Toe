I built a single-player tic-tac-toe game.
Rules :-
The grid is numbered as follows:
         |         |
    1    |    2    |    3     
_________|_________|_________
         |         |
    4    |    5    |    6     
_________|_________|_________
         |         |
    7    |    8    |    9     
         |         |

First, you are required to select the letter with which you want to play - X or O
You are supposed to enter a number which will be the position where you want to insert the letter (The cells and their corresponding positions are shown above)
The player who gets 3 consecutive Xs or Os(horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins.
